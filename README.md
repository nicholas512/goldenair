The relevant files are:

```
data/purpleair/purpleair.csv - hourly purpleair sensor data
data/bc_aqi_E292149/aggregated.csv - hourly AQI from helipad station (E292149)
data/VI/venting_index.csv - twice-daily venting index forecast
data/weather/meteo.zip - (zipped) Environment Canada weather from stations ("Golden A", "Golden Helipad")
data/aggregated_long.csv - (in progress) working on creating a single file with everything in it 
```

Scripts to compile and gather data are messy and still use absolute paths.
